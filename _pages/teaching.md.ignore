#### 2023 - 2024 (Teaching and working at university level)

As part of the "DÂ³ Innovation Lab" project, an initiative to further student's data literacy, I held a workshop and worked in teaching. Lead by Stephan Leible and Dr. Maren Gierlich-Joas. (University of Hamburg, Faculty of Informatics)

- In a workshop I introduced students to a 3D-room planner software.
Afterwards the students, in groups of 2-3, designed an exploration room and documented their process and decisions.
Their designs are supposed to be the basis for an actual room at the University of Hamburg, providing students a place to work and study in groups or alone.
- As part of a seminar in the fall of 2023, I held a lecture and tutored groups of students. 
The aim was to help them to define their own research question, explore related research and work towards a written elaboration of their topic.
