I never had anything close to "my own blog" before and I am not sure if I will get used to all these "social media" that seem to be used in academia so much... But I will give it a try and see how it turns out! :D
Worst case: I produce a lot of senseless text data that can later be used to train a "Christian-Model" for future generations to converse with! ;D
