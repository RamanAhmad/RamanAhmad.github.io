Your throat starts scratching, the nose runs away, your head feels like put into cotton, you drink water all day and run half a marathon between your chair and the loo, you sneeze and cough and scare off anyone with a speck of good sense!

But the truly beautiful aspect of it all?

Once you are finally done with a cold, you can truly appreciate your "being healthy", instead of just taking it for granted, as we so often tend to do.
